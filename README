PDFedit readme
-----------------

For more detailed documentation, look into "doc" subdirectory.
File doc/user/user_doc.html contain more detailed installation instructions
(in the Installation section) and list of required libraries.

Compilation
-----------
 Run:
  ./configure

 Optionally you can specify prefix (default is /usr/local/) or other parameters.
 Run "./configure --help" to see list of possible configuration parameters.

 After configure succesfully finishes, run "make" in this directory to start
 compilation.

Installation
------------
 To install editor, run
  make install

 INSTALL_ROOT environment variable can be used to install into different
 root directory, which can be useful for example when creating packages
 or if installing into chroot jail.

 Example:
  INSTALL_ROOT=/chroot/pdfedit make install

Cygwin build
------------
PATH in cygwin must contain these three directories
/bin			(most required executables are stashed here)
/usr/X11R6/bin		(some libraries are here)
/usr/lib/qt3/bin	(qmake must be in PATH)

You can use cygwin_build.bat to start the build process
(you will need to set CYGWIN_ROOT in the file first)
This will create the package in /tmp/pdfedit-package
and create pack.bat to pack the package with 7-zip
