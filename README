Prerequisites
=============
Base (kernel), pdfedit5-code-dev package, xcb
---------------------------------------
Boost libraries must be installed. See detailed description about configure
parameters if you have some unusual installation.
Freetype library is almost necessary, because nearly all PDFs use these fonts.
T1 font library is also recommended.

Tests
-----
Unlike PDFedit, PDFEdit5 is still on development and and haven't been tested yet against CPPUNIT library,
so don't blame if something didn't work. Indeed, nothing work at this right moment.
See detailed description about configure parameters if you have some unusual installation.

Tools
-----
All tools use boost-program-options library so it has to be installed on your
system if you want to compile them (see later how to enable them). Some
distributions use a separate package (e.g. Debian) but most others include
it directly into boost package.
add_image tool uses libpng and its headers so libpng-dev package has to be 
installed.

Gui
---
Make sure you have all needed libraries (qt5, boost and xcb) along with their 
headers. 
You also need the environment variable QTDIR to be set to directory in which 
the Qt toolkit (version 5) is installed. Many distributions already set this 
when installing Qt, but some of them don't. In that case, you have to set the 
QTDIR manually. Usually it is set to something like /usr/lib/qt5 or /usr/share/qt5
(use e. g. export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt35to set the variable if this is your 
case).  
Also, while usually not needed, QMAKESPEC may be set to match your system type.
For most systems it is unnecessary to set it, although it may be needed if you
cross-compile (like producing i386 binaries on amd64 platform) or in some rare
configurations. Once you set QTDIR, you may try typing "ls $QTDIR/mkspecs".
QMAKESPEC should be set to name of one of the directories that are in mkspecs
subdirectory in the Qt directory.
See https://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools or 
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qmake-manual.html for more information.
QTDIR is used also for qmake (tool for generating makefiles from QT project
files) detection. By default, this is stored somewhere under QTDIR directory
(typically QTDIR/bin/), but there are also platforms, where this is not 
exactly true. If you have such a platform, try to use --with-qmake-dir
parameter to configure (see bellow)

Documentation
=============
There are 3 levels of documentation in this project.
* Basic - in the form of the man page which is always installed 
* doxygen - programming documentation extracted from sources and
	    processed by doxygen tool. Obviously, doxygen has to
	    be installed.
	    This documentation is not created and installed by
	    default and you have to explicitly enable it by
	    --enable-doxygen-doc parameter to ./configure
	    Result documentation is placed in the DOC_PATH/doxygen
	    directory (DOC_PATH is PREFIX/share/doc/pdfedit)
	    It is strongly recommended for pdfedit-core-dev package
	    done by distributors.
* user manual - html pages with user manual about PDFedit usage.
	    This documentation is not created by default and you
	    have to enable it by configure parameter
	    --enable-user-manual. We are using xml based docbook
	    format, so you have to have docbook xsl and xsltproc
	    installed. 
	    Result documentation is placed in the DOC_PATH/manual
	    directory.
* advanced - design documentation which describes inner data 
	    structures, algorithms and relations from the 
	    programmer perspective. This one is useful if you
	    want to develop PDFedit5 or 3rd party application based
	    on PDFedit5.
	    This documentation is not created by default too and
	    you have to enable it by configure parameter 
	    --enable-advanced-doc. We are using xml based docbook
	    format, so you have to have docbook xsl and xsltproc
	    installed. 
	    Result documentation is placed in the DOC_PATH/design/
	    directory.

Configuration
=============
 Run:
  ./configure [parameters]

NOTE for those who use sources from GIT. configure is NO MORE part of the
GIT tree!!! You have to generate it. This can be done simply by
$ autoconf
in the root of the checkout project. Note that you have to have autoconf
package installed on your machine.

Simple run without any parameter results in default configuration where 
application is compiled in release mode (optimizations turned on, debug
symbols are not present, compilation warnings are eliminated), GUI is
enabled, doxygen documentation is generated, no kernel tests (stored in 
src/kernel/tests/) are compiled and application will be installed into the
/usr/local/pdfedit directory.

Configuration enables also compilation and installation in so called
pdfedit-core-dev package which prepares all libraries and header files for
3rd party application which want to reuse our core (kernel) functionality 
(see more in the Pdfedit devel package bellow).
This is not done by default and you have to enable it explicitly by
--enable-pdfedit-dev-core configure parameter.
Note that development package and gui can be mixed together but also single
dev. package can be created by disabling gui (see bellow).
pdfedit-dev-core installation comes with pdfedit-core-dev-config script
which can be used by 3rd party code for its configuration to correctly set
compiler flags include paths, libraries and so on.

Configure features
------------------
You can change this behavior with following parameters (feature is used
if --enable- prefix is used, contrary --disable- prefix turns off this
feature - e.g. if feature name stack-protector => --enable-stack-protector 
uses this feature):
	-stack-protector - adds stack protector parameter to the compilation
	 flags. Disabled by default, because not all compilers support this
	 feature (gcc > 4.1 supports it)

	-release - controls compilation flags for release mode (no debugging
	 needed). This is used by default. It means that optimizations are
	 turned on, debug information is not included in the result binary.
	 If you want to debug or do some development, --disable-release is
	 strongly recommended.

	-debug-info - if --enable-release is used and you still need debug
	 information (e.g. when application crashes to have some reasonable
	 stack traces) use --enable-debug-info. This parameter feature would
	 be ignored if --disable-release is used.
	
	-observer-debug - just for developers only. Disabled by default. If
	 turned on, some more debug information is added to the kernel code
	 to enable debugging observers based code.

	-gui - Creates GUI for PDFedit5 (pdfedit5 binary). Enabled by default. 
	 If --disable-gui is used, no GUI (no pdfedit binary is created).
	
	-kernel-tests - Compiles all kernel tests (in src/kernel/tests). 
	 Disabled by default and intended for developers/testers only. Note
	 that this requires to have CPPUNIT installed on your system.

	-tools - Compiles all tools which are available in src/tools.  Disabled
	 by default and intended for those interested in simple examples of
	 pdfedit-core-dev library usage and those who need some simple tools for
	 pdf manipulation/analyzes and don't want to use GUI or scripting
	 (pdf_to_text, flattener, delinerizator, pdf_object_comparer, etc.).
	 Note that you need also --enable-pdfedit-core-dev for tools.
	
	-doxygen-doc - generates also doxygen documentation useful for 
	 programmers. Disabled by default. Note that doxygen has to be
	 installed for this feature.

	-user-manual - generates also docbook user manual documentation.
	 Disabled by default. Note that docbook and its prerequisites
	 have to be installed for this feature.

	-advanced-doc - generates also docbook design documentation.
	 Disabled by default. Note that docbook and its prerequisites
	 have to be installed for this feature.
	
	-pdfedit-core-dev - generates libraries needed for 3rd party
	 applications which want to use pdfedit kernel core. Moreover 
	 make install will install also header files, libraries and
	 pdfedit-core-dev-config helper script (see Installation directories
	 bellow). This option is disabled by default.
	-poratability-flags - adds compiler flags which force c99/c++98 
	 standard and posix/ansi portability. This option is enabled by default.

Default configuration process will check for the number of CPUs/cores and 
use this value for make jobs parallelization (each make will use different
CPU/core). You can change this behavior with --with-parallel-make=VALUE 
where VALUE is one of the:
	- auto (default) - (on Linux - checks /proc/cpuinfo and use the CPU
	  counts for the number of parallel make jobs).
	- off - no parallelization
	- number - the number of parallel make jobs (positive number
	  expected)
Default behavior (no need for --with-parallel-make parameter) should be OK
in almost all situations (with benefit of shorter built time), however if 
you have specific requirements when you don't want/can't use all your
CPUs/cores for compilation you can use either off or precise number of
parallel jobs.


Libraries and binaries specification
------------------------------------
You can also control search paths for required libraries and binaries:

	- Freetype2 font library
	./configure --with-ft-prefix=PATH_TO_YOUR_FREETYPE2
	resp. (for T1)
	
	- T1 font library
	./configure --with-t1-includes=PATH_TO_YOUR_T1_HEADERS \
		--with-t1-library=PATH_TO_YOUR_T1_LIB
	
	- CPPUnit
	./configure  --with-cppunit-prefix=PATH_TO_YOUR_CPPUNIT

	- Boost
	./configure --with-boost=YOUR_BOOST_INSTALLATION_PATH \
		--with-boost-libdir=YOUR_BOOST_LIB_PATH 

	- qmake is searched in $QTDIR/bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin,
	  /usr/lib/qt5/bin and in directories in $PATH. If you have
	  qmake installed in other directory, use:
	./configure --with-qmake=QMAKE_BINARY_WITH_PATH

	- QT comes with lrelease binary which is used for 
	  localization data files translation. This binary is
	  searched in $QTDIR/bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin,
	  /usr/lib/qt5/bin and in directories in $PATH.
	  If it is not found on your system, please use
	./configure --with-lrelease-bin=LRELEASE_BINARY_WITH_PATH

	- doxygen is searched in /usr/bin , /usr/local/bin and 
	  current PATH directories. If you have doxygen installed
	  in other directory, use:
	./configure --with-doxygen=DOXYGEN_BINARY_WITH_PATH

	- xsltproc is  searched in /usr/bin , /usr/local/bin and 
	  current PATH directories. If you have xsltproc installed
	  in other directory, use:
	./configure --with-xsltproc=XSLTPROC_BINARY_WITH_PATH

	- docbook xslt files are necessary for xsltproc to generate
	  correct output from docbook xml files. There are many
	  places where these files can be found. As many systems
	  use different directories and there is no general way
	  to detect, we are using file doc/tools/docbook_xslt_paths
	  to define all possible directories which are searched.
	  If you are sure that you have installed package with
	  this file (usually stored ...html/dobook.xsl) add its 
	  absolute path  to this file (each directory should be on the 
	  separate line and can use wildchars). If you report missing 
	  directory for your platform, we can add it in the next release.

See ./configure --help for more information about this parameters.

Installation directories
------------------------
All files are by default installed under /usr/local subdirectory (binary
into /usr/local/bin, config files into /usr/local/share/pdfedit etc.).
This location can be changed by --prefix parameter to configure (PREFIX
in the following).

PDFedit binary location can be controlled by --exec-prefix (EPREFIX in
the following) and it is stored under EPREFIX/bin. EPREFIX is the
same like PREFIX by default.

Documentation files are copied to PREFIX/share/pdfedit/doc, configuration
files and scripts are copied to PREFIX/share/pdfedit and man page is
copied to PREFIX/share/man/man1.

If pdfedit5-core-dev is configured, all relevant header files are copied into
INCLUDEDIR/pdfedit5-version (INCLUDEDIR=PREFIX/include by default), static
libraries are copied into LIBDIR/pdfedit-version (LIBDIR=EPREFIX/lib by
default) and pdfedit5-core-dev-config script copied into the binary path as
described for PDFedit bunary.

If you need to change installation root (e. g. if you are packager and
want to create package or use chrooted environment) use
	--with-root-dir=YOUR_INSTALLATION_ROOT_DIR
Everything will then be installed with complete directory structure relative
to that directory instead of real root directory (using correct PREFIX and
EPREFIX of course). Note that you cannot just execute PDFedit from that
directory straight away, as the files must be present in real root directory
for editor to function properly.
If you want just to move the installation elsewhere (in your home directory,
for example), use --prefix parameter for that.

Installation directories for specific parts (binary, documentation, 
configuration files) can be also controlled by configure parameters.
	--bindir controls directory where the pdfedit binary is copied
	--libdir controls directory where the pdfedit-core-dev libraries are
	  installed
	--includedir controls directory where the pdfedit-core-dev header
	  files are installed
	--docdir controls directory where documentation is copied
	--mandir controls directory where the man page is copied. Note that
	  we provide only man 1 pdfedit, so that man page is actually copied
	  under man1 sub-directory under specified one.
	--datadir controls directory where configuration files are stored
	  (files are actually stored in pdfedit package name subdirectory)

You can use following variables if you want to customize above directories:
	prefix - value set as --prefix (usually /usr/local)
	exec_prefix - value set as --exec_prefix (usually same as PREFIX)
	datarootdir - root directory for all pdfedit data (usually PREFIX/share)
	version - current version
	package_name - installed package name

Example for multiple simultaneous versions installation:
	# Note that quotes are necessary here because bash (and some other 
	# shells may too) would run subshell for $(expression)  otherwise
	# Also note that man page will be overwritten by each installation.
	./configure --bindir='$(exec_prefix)/$(package_name)-$(version)' \
		--docdir='$(datarootdir)/doc/$(package_name)-$(version)' \
		--datadir='$(datarootdir)/$(package_name)-$(version)' 


Compilation
===========

After configure successfully finishes, run "make" in this directory to start
compilation (note that GNU make is preferred bacause we are using some GNU
make features which might be not available with other make implementations).

If you need (for what ever reason) to change or explicitly specify other than
default compiler, you can do it during configuration phase by passing your
compiler as CC and CXX configure parameters. The first one stands for c files 
compiler while the second is used for c++ files.
Lets say that we have gcc v 4.7 as default and want to compile with the newest
gcc 4.8.2. Then you should do something like (name of compiler binary may
vary on different systems - this one is for Debian):
	./configure CC=gcc-4.8.2 CXX=g++-4.8.2

Note that CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS which can be standardly passed to configure
are ignored by our configure script.

However you can influence compiler parameters with the following variables:
	- ARCH for architecture specific parameters
	- C_EXTRA for CC flags
	  (-fmessage-length=0 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fno-strict-aliasing will
	  be used if not defined)
	- CXX_EXTRA for CXX flags
	  (-fmessage-length=0 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fexceptions 
	  will be used if not defined)
	- EXTRA_UTILS_CFLAGS, EXTRA_KERNEL_CFLAGS, EXTRA_TESTS_CFLAGS, EXTRA_XPDF_CFLAGS 
	  used for CC flags for utils resp. kernel resp. tests directory (only
	  for internal/developers usage)
	- EXTRA_UTILS_CXXFLAGS, EXTRA_KERNEL_CXXFLAGS, EXTRA_TESTS_CXXFLAGS,
	  EXTRA_GUI_CXXFLAGS, EXTRA_XPDF_CXXFLAGS same like the above for CXX

Installation
============
 To install editor, run
  make install

Note that all files will be installed according to defined prefix and 
if --with-root-dir was specified for configure, then prefix is relative 
to the specified root.

Cygwin build
============
PATH in cygwin must contain these three directories
/bin			(most required executables are stashed here)
/usr/X11R6/bin		(some libraries are here)
/usr/lib/qt5/bin	(qmake must be in PATH)

You can use cygwin_build.bat to start the build process (you will need 
to set CYGWIN_ROOT in the file first). This will create the package in 
/tmp/pdfedit5-package and create pack.bat to pack the package with 7-zip

Please note that the original authors from PDFedit have received reports about PDFedit failing to compile
under some Cygwin releases. The problem turned out to be related to 
implementation of c++ standard wrt. to some functions definitions (e.g. mkstemp)
under Cygwin.
The only reasonable solution is turning off portability and c/c++ standards
compiler flags. Please use --enable-portability-flags=no if you encounters
these problems.


FreeBSD build
=============
Here is the short howto for PDFedit compilation and installation on FreeBSD 6.2 
(Qt 3.38, Xorg 7.2). Thanks to Hao Chen. PDFedit5 is still not available in FreeBSD, but we left here as a legacy

# untar current sources (this was done for 0.3.1 version)
tar zxvf pdfedit-0.3.1.tar.bz2
cd pdfedit-0.3.1
setenv QTDIR /usr/local
setenv QMAKESPEC /usr/local/share/qt/mkspecs/freebsd-g++
setenv LOCALBASE /usr/local
./configure  --with-t1-library="${LOCALBASE}/lib" \
	--with-t1-includes="${LOCALBASE}/include"

#make sure you see this:
#checking for T1_InitLib in -lt1... yes
#using t1 library

Our makefiles use some extensions of GNU make, so it is recomended to use
gmake instead!


NetBSD installation
===================
Package for NetBSD for the old PDFedit is available on http://pkgsrc.se/wip/pdfedit
As for PDFedit5 nothing is realeased yet


Debian package
==============
We haven't already got any package or official repo, so please wait until the project is finished
See http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/pdfedit

The package for the Ubuntu can by found at 
http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/utils/pdfedit

And if you want to create deb package by your self, Eric Doviak 
(thanks for this howto) suggests:

First, install the packages necessary to build PDF Editor.

# apt-get install dh-make libboost-dev 

Then, download the tarball from Sourceforge and extracted the files:

$ tar -zxf pdfedit_1.0.0.tar.gz

Next, enter the pdfedit-1.0.0/ directory and run dh_make

$ cd pdfedit-1.0.0/
$ dh_make --createorig

Choose to create a single binary. After running dh_make, open the
pdfedit-1.0.0/debian/rules file and comment out (#) line 48:

# $(MAKE) distclean

Then, run:

$ export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt5
$ dpkg-buildpackage

That creates the DEB package that you can install with:

# dpkg -i pdfedit_1.0.0-1_i386.deb


RPM based distros
=================
* We have nothing yet, so please wait. Also I develop mainly in Fedora, so you have a clue which distro will have first the package

Gentoo package
==============
Package is not yet on any repository, the old PDFedit is available on sunrise overlay repository
which should be available in following way:

emerge -va layman
echo "source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf
layman -f -a sunrise

pdfedit is then installed by:
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=~x86 emerge -av pdfedit

Altlinux 64b
============
Altlinux has boost libraries stored in /usr/lib64 directory. This
directory is not searched by default. Therefore you have to set 
library path by hand with --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib64.


PDFedit5 devel package
=====================
PDFedit5 core functionality (read as non-gui) can be reused by 3rd party
applications. For this purpose, we have provided separate configuration
options and installation targets as described above.
If you want to use this package following steps are required:
* install pdfedit-core-dev package (either from distribution package if
  available or from sources as described above).
* There are two possibilities to properly setup compiler and linker flags
  to compile your application correctly.
  - manual Makefile way
    You should use EPREFIX/pdfedit-core-dev-config script 
	e.g. this way in Makefile:
	CXXFLAGS = $(shell pdfedit-core-dev-config --cflags)
	LDFLAGS = $(shell pdfedit-core-dev-config --libs)

  - autoconf way
    pdfedit source package comes with the config/pdfedit5-core-dev.m4 autoconf
    macro file which exports AX_PDFEDIT5_CORE_DEV macro. Just call it and use
    the exported variables PDFEDIT5_CORE_DEV_CPPFLAGS and PDFEDIT5_CODE_DEV_LDFLAGS 
    in your Makefile. Read more about possible parameters directly in the file.
* update your sources which are using pdfedit-core-dev:
	- initialize library by:
	if(pdfedit_core_dev_init())
	{
		// Fatal error in initialization
		exit();
	}
	before you call any PDFedit related code
	- cleanup library stuff at the end when pdfedit-core-dev is no
	  longer used by:
	pdfedit5_core_dev_destroy();
        [See doxygen documentation for these functions for more information]
