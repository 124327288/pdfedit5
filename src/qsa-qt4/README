Differences of included build against stock QSA 1.2.2:

* Removed examples, documentation and similar unnecessary stuff
* Renamed library from qsa to qsa_pdfedit to avoid collisions
* Modified the build process to allow using different qmake
  (on some systems using "qmake" will invoke Qt4 qmake, while
  Qt3 qmake is under different name and/or path)
* Removed mention of commercial license - since this instance
  of QSA is inserted into GPL'ed project, it's now GPL only.
* Fixed "make distclean" not cleaning everything it should.
