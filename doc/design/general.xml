	<title>PDFEdit general overview</title>
	<para>
		PDFEdit project is based on 3 layers model:
		<mediaobject>
		  <imageobject>
			  <imagedata fileref="images/layers.png" format="PNG"/>
		  </imageobject>
		  <caption><para>PDFedit layers</para></caption>
		</mediaobject>

		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>Kernel - which has responsibility to maintain pdf
			document content and provides with interface for
			changes.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>Script - which has responsibility to wrap kernel 
			interface and export it to user or gui.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>Gui - which visualize and makes comfortable usage of 
			all the functionality which is accessible directly from 
			kernel or Script layers.
		</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
		Kernel layer is build on top of popular open source &xpdf_link_index; 
		project. 
		It reuses xpdf code for low-level pdf document access - reading 
		and decoding content and parsing it to objects as well as 
		displaying functionality. Xpdf objects are transformed to 
		interface internal pdfedit obejcts which provides additional
		logic and as such they are exported to higher layers.
	</para>
	<para> 
		Script layer is base on &qsa_link_index; - Qt script for applications - 
		developed by Trolltech. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Gui layer uses &qt_link_index; framework also developed by Trolltech. 
		Most of gui parts are based on scripts. This means that user interface 
		is very flexible and changes are possible without need of code
		recompilation or they can be done in runtime.
