        <title>PDFEdit general design overview</title>
        <para>
                PDFEdit project is build on top of popular open source 
                <ulink url="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">Xpdf</ulink> project. 
                It reuses xpdf code for low-level pdf document access - reading 
                and decoding content and parsing it to objects as well as 
                displaying functionality. xpdf objects are transformed to 
                PDFedit special objects (TODO link CObject)  
                which provides interface for comunication between higher layers,
                making changes to objects and finally make the rest of the code
                at least dependant as possible.

        <para>
                TODO describe used libraries and techniques (boost - filter 
                streams, smart pointers; STL - containers, exceptions; QSA -
                scripting; Qt - gui; Valgrind - memleaks discovering; doxygen -
                programming documentation generation; docbook - hand written
                documentation; design patterns - objects designing). Divide 
                them to design, code writing, documentation cathegories.
