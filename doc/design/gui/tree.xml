  <title>Object tree view</title>
  <para>
   Structure of PDF can be represented as a tree, and as such, it is shown in the treeview.
   However, there are some problems:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
     Many elements (such as page) are in the tree two or more times, often with different
     representation (List of pages vs. complicated tree structure in Pages dictionary).
     When you modify one of them, the others usually change in some way too.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     The tree contain references (analogous to a symbolic link in unix filesystems) and
     these references can contain cycles
     (reference in tree A can point to tree B, while some other reference in tree B point to tree A).
     In fact, the cycles are very common, for example page always have link to its
     parent page dictionary in which it is contained.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     Single item can be referenced multiple times from different parts of tree.
     Common example are fonts, as one font is usually referenced in Resources dictionary on multiple pages.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     The tree is very large. Even tree of very small file with single page contain
     over 1000 items and huge documents (like the PDF specification for example,
     which have 1236 pages) will have probably over one million tree items.
     (as the tree items are branched to very detailed level,
      basically to level of single words in most documents)
     This is problem, partially because of memory taken by too many items,
     and mainly, most users are unable to orient in such a large tree effectively.
    </para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <sect1>
   <title>MultiTreeWindow class</title>
   <para>
    Class providing tree view of PDF objects.
    It does support multiple tabs, showing individual trees inside them.
   <para>
   </para>
    Splitting the tree to multiple tabs partially solve the user disorientation problem,
    as all content streams are opened in tabs, thus their operator tree does not clutter
    the "main" tree view showing pages, annotations, outlines, etc ...
   </para>
   <para>
    This window show list of tabs, with one "main" tab that contain the document as root element
    and zero or more "secondary" tabs, than show some elements from main tree more in detail.
    The main tree cannot be closed and is fixed to showing the PDF document as its root item.
    Secondary trees can be closed any time when the user think they are no longer needed.
   </para>
   <para>
    Single tree in the multi tree window is managed by TreeWindow class
   </para>
  </sect1>  
  <sect1>
   <title>TreeWindow class</title>
   <para>
    Class providing tree view of PDF objects, having one object at root and showing its children.
    It uses QListView for showing the tree and all items that are inside the QListView are derived
    from TreeItemAbstract class (which is derived from ordinary QListViewItem class)
    Also, the TreeWindow bring some limitation to the QListView in it, most notable, you can only
    put items that are derived from TreeItemAbstract class, not ordinary QListViewItem
    (if you bypass this limitation, you can expect strange behavior) and the listview must have
    at most one root item - this is required by GUI logic that tree correspond to something,
    either the document or some part of it (or the tree is empty).
    Also, it simplifies some things.
