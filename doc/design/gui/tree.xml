  <title>Object tree view</title>
  <para>
   Structure of PDF can be represented as a tree, and as such, it is shown in the treeview.
   However, there are some problems:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
     Many elements (such as page) are in the tree two or more times, often with different
     representation (List of pages vs. complicated tree structure in Pages dictionary)
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     The tree contain references (analogous to a symbolic link in unix filesystems) and
     these references can contain cycles
     (reference in tree A can point to tree B, while some other reference in tree B point to tree A).
     In fact, the cycles are very common, for example page always have link to its
     parent page dictionary in which it is contained
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     Single item can be referenced multiple times from different parts of tree.
     Common example are fonts, as one font is usually referenced in Resources dictionary on multiple pages
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     The tree is very large. Even tree of very small file with single page contain
     over 1000 items and huge documents (like the PDF specification for example,
     which have 1236 pages) will have probably over one million tree items
    </para></listitem>
