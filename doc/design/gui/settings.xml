  <title>Settings system</title>
  <para>
   PDF Editor uses <classname>QSettings</classname> and <classname>StaticSettings</classname>
   as backend to store its configuration.
   Internally, <classname>StaticSettings</classname> is used for static settings
   (which cannot be modified) and <classname>QSettings</classname> for dynamic settings.
   We can see the static settings as system settings and dynamic settings as user settings. 
   Setting uses key/value scheme, where the keys maintain some directory-like hierarchy,
   with components separated by slash - "/". This helps managing related settings together.
   Only limitation is that first and last character in settings should not be slash
   and there should not be two consecutive slashes in the key, otherwise unpredictable
   behavior might occur.
  </para>
  <para>
   Any value specified in user settings overrides corresponding value in system
   (static) settings, so basically only values not found in user settings are
   searched in system settings.

   <title>Static (system) Settings</title>
   <para>
    Static settings are stored in file <filename>pdfeditrc</filename>.
    This file is looked for at application start, first in data directory
    (which is defined in <filename>config.h</filename> in GUI source directory)
    and if not found there, next is searched the directory,
    where the editor executable is located.
    <classname>StaticSettings</classname> class handles reading of this file.
   </para>

   <title>File format for static settings</title>
   <para>
    The format is very similar to the format of "ini file", but have been improved
    to allow indentation and comments, so the file is better readable and manageable.

   <title>Dynamic (user) Settings</title>
   <para>
    Static settings are stored in file <filename>pdfeditrc</filename>
    in subdirectory <filename>.pdfedit</filename> in user's home directory.
    Nota that most other settings (any custom scripts, icons, etc ...) are stored by default
    in that directory too.
    This file is read by <classname>QSettings</classname> class on application start and when last window
    is closed, the settings are writen back (if they were modified).
    Also, the file is explicitly written when user presses <guibutton>Ok</guibutton>
    or <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button in Option dialog (to avoid losing settings
    if the program crashes or is killed)
    or if requested by script, for example by calling <code>settings.flush()</code>.
   </para>
  </sect1>

   <title>File format for user settings</title>
   <para>
    The format is basically an "ini file". You can not insert any comments in the file
    or indent it, as it is not supported by the <classname>QSettings</classname>
    configuration file parser and they'll be overwritten anyway when the file is updated.
