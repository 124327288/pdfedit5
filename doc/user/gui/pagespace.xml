			<title>Changing page information</title>
			<para>
					There are two independent information in page space which must be actualized.
			</para>
			<para>
					First is the page and information about page count in the document.
					This part is updated only if someone calls script function
					<emphasis>go()</emphasis> because it's very slow operation (to update
					page after each change could be a performance problem).
					Reload page button in toolbars and menu (and many other useful
					functions) call <emphasis>go()</emphasis> automatically.
					But direct changes in <xref linkend="gui_objtreepropedit_id" />
					and changes using scripting do not update the page and page count automatically.
			</para>
			<para>
					The second is the mouse position on page. Position must be converted to 
					internal coordinates. The position does not depend on zoom level
					or actual rotation of page. (If the text starte at position
					[x:6, y:7 cm] in 100% zoom the same position will be used to started the text
					in 200% zoom.)
					<para>
							Notice: Most common practise is to have the zero in the left-bottom edge of page and
							to have the maximum in right-top edge.
					</para>
					
			</para>
			<para>
					It can happen that after a zoom change the outer page space is not updated. 
					To corret this call either script <emphasis>go()</emphasis> function or click the 
					reload page button.
			</para>

			<title>Popup menu</title>
			<para>
					Right click of a mouse displayes a menu which will be displayed near the cursor.
					You can choose among two functions. Firstly to
					<emphasis>Save page as image</emphasis>. Secondly to
					<emphasis>Save selected area as image</emphasis> which can be used only when a selection
					is already present.
			</para>
			<para>
					Both functions store portion of viewed page to an image file.
					Format of the image file is depending on the system and version of Qt.
			</para>
			<para>
					<emphasis>Save page as image</emphasis> stores actual viewed page to an image file.
					If only a part of a page is displayed, only the part of page is stored.
			</para>
			<para>
					<emphasis>Save selected area as image</emphasis> stores only actual selected area.
					If selected area is fragmented or has not a rectangle shape, then a bounding
					rectangle of selected area is sotred. If selected area is bigger then actual displayed part of 
					page, storing
					area is cropped with same rectangle as page is cropped in <emphasis>Save page as image</emphasis>.
