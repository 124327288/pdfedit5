Win32 pdfedit release
---------------------------
Pdfedit win32 release currently contains binary tools, its sources and this readme. Binaries are built using visual studio 2008. Follow the step by step procedure below to compile it for yourself. 

Note: This is beta release and the source code was neither unified nor polished. The purpose is to show how simple it is to write your pdf utility using our pdfedit kernel.


Step-by-step how to compile pdfedit* tools from tools_library 
---------------------------

   1) get BOOST (http://www.boost-consulting.com/products/free) with additional dependencies - program_options, filesystem, iostreams
   2) get ZLIB (http://www.zlib.net/)
   3) (for tests) get CPPUNIT (http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=cppunit&filename=cppunit-1.12.0.tar.gz&use_mirror=surfnet)
   4) set includes/library directories in Visual Studio in either 
        Tools->Options->Project&Solutions->VC++ Directories->Include Files-> 
        OR 
        pdfedit->Property Pages->C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories
   5) build solution using "Debug-Tools|Win32" configuration

Troubleshooting
---------------------------

  1) ensure zlib, cppunit is linked against the same library type as pdfedit - default is "Multi-threaded Debug"
