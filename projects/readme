Win32 pdfedit* release
---------------------------
The main purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the underlying pdfedit library. Currently, there are several tools which can be used from command line and proof of concept win32 GUI. 

Pdfedit Win32 release is beta. It also means that all executables are compiled in debug mode and therefore are slower and bigger; however, the functionality is the same.  

We use Visual Studio 2008 for building and CRT is statically linked. This means that no dll hell/incorrect runtime environment problems occur but there is significant file size overhead.

Problems
---------------------------
Please, feel free to report any problems on pdfedit-support@lists.sourceforge.net or visit https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfedit/ for more information.


Step-by-step instructions on how to compile pdfedit 
---------------------------

   0) get sources from cvs on https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfedit/
   
   1) get BOOST (http://www.boost-consulting.com/products/free) with additional dependencies - program_options, filesystem and iostreams
   
   2) get FREETYPE2 - https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.3.12/ft2312.zip/download, extract it to a directory
   
   3) get ZLIB - http://www.zlib.net/ and extract it to a directory
   
   4) OPTIONAL - get libpng for add_image tool from http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
   
   5) OPTIONAL - get cppunit for tests from https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page  

   6) set include directories in Visual Studio for BOOST, FREETYPE2, ZLIB in either 
        Tools->Options->Project&Solutions->VC++ Directories->Include files/Library files
        
   7) build solution using one of possible configuration


Troubleshooting
---------------------------

  1) if you want to compile it against library versions of zlib/freetype you have to use the same Runtime libraries (MT, MTd, ...)
