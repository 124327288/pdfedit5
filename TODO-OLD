OLD TODO list:
Haven't check nothing from here yet
----------

GUI
Miro (all is now bugtracker)
 BT[x] Bug: setOpColor graphical pre operatory
 [x] Adding text "inline" straight to the page - Miro
 [x] Editing text -> In the text box, but remove all operators except the last one and the first one will have a new text - Miro
 [x] The correct setting cm operator when inserting new object - script function
  -> [x] The correct setting font size when font size changes at any Operator
  -> BT [ ] operatory MoveAbove, MoveBelow, REsize, Move (iba pre graficky) -> pro vyselectene ze sranky
 [x] Bug: repair of text-selection of operators
 [x] bbox is in some weird units nas conversion functions are displayparams in CPage ... somehow the data to scripting - baseconsole??
  -> [x] add convertPixmapPosToPdfPos also for commandline (Part baseGUI and baseCMD) (data in BASE)
  ?  Text search - Throughout the document + dialog to edit + search history (within the session) - Miro - ?
  ?  Draw a circle and of other primitives?
  ?  Jump at the target annotation (look at Target in xpdf) - Miro
 [x] Mod: Crossing out, highlighting the text (colored square under the text) - Miro
  -> [x]Error setting CM
 [x] actualize selection issue was left operatory
 [x] Changing units (cm, inches, ...) + patch scripts
  -> [x] Edit page metric was left
 [x] Sort units by size, come back in some nicer shape with a description
 [x] Bug: If the vyselectena annotation and if you open a new document, highlight remains
 [x] In the annotation mode to draw a box around annotation
 [x] Find out how it is with PdfOperator.getBBox in console mode
Michal
 [ ] DOPS vic commandline script than just delinearizator
     (at least something usefull - concat documents, even / odd ...)
     -> Make it a grandiose example to take. guide (we put together some common)
?
 [ ] Everywhere treat all exceptions from the kernel, and then throw the message "This pdf is defective ...." -> reminder to check
  ?  script to saltation on target after clicking on the docket
  ?  Toolbar Widget to select the current line style
  ?  Toggle icons at runtime without reloading
  ?  Wrapper with the general parameters QObject If the wrong parameter throw a TypeError not just silently fail (someone already, but check if it's everywhere)
  ?  TreeItemRef -> target is somewhere in the parent tree. Find out what makes squashed arrow on treeitem (in code of QT)
     and accordingly then do a little more consistent cursor in this "pathologies"
  ?  Show only recent changes to the page - the kernel - if anyone remembers what it was like.
????? Windows build (about only through cygwin due to xpdf / splashdevice) - wishlist
 ??? Slovakia localization :)
 ??? Inserting a "template items" from the PDF (Somehow patterning or something like that)
 ??? Value based tree reloading - reloading better optimization for array-based tree items (list of operators, CArray)
     - things that are not identified as key etc but i dict value
 ??? TreeItemRef - support deepreload () - optimization when reloading
 ??? Recently opened documents at menu + set their homage to what is stored
 ??? QSA wrappers Counseling treat memory leaks (garbage when you close the window is too late :)
 ??? "Plugin Scripts" -> must add the function to the added menu items / menus / toolbars / toolbuttons at runtime without changing the configuration
 ??? "Plugin Scripts" -> function to be more dynamic registration callback
 ??? "Plugin Scripts" -> some AutoUpdater? (via QHttp and dialogue)
 ???  Wrapper around Const cdict (treeitem) -?
 ???  Option for displaying reference in tabs / primo, the same for contentstreamy
     - for things that are to be displayed in the taboo should childs () at treeitem return an empty list if it is not treeitem in spices
     - Same with reference to what will not open, like the reference to the parent (there tio but had already operate)
 ??? Automatically tests the GUI (it would have probably even a little something to finish scripting, but then something would test slo)
 ??? Correctly restore the splitter if it was something hidden and there was an exit and reopen the matter
 ??? Popup menu to switch the taboo multitree could be in alphabetical order
 ??? Dictionary Page View as indirect object instead of directly "Dictionary" Determine the indirect object (IndiRef, getReference()) and put on it a reference
     + the tree is the total min items, I know what object it is
     - I have a level more in tree
 ??? Save / load to streams (save to disk, replace the disk) - future wishlist

Final
 [ ] compile-DNDEBUG (without a debug ASSERT)

Scripting
  ?  add getAllAnnotations
 ??? Wrapper around Const cdict -> for reading things from the trailer. Alternatively, the data and then into a tree

Kernel
 ??? Decryption/Encryption - future wishlist
 [s] Slide the contenstreamu a level higher / lower
 ??? Filter (LZW, FlateDecode, ..)
 [o] Only returns the last change as pdfoperatory? as cstream?

Documentation
 [ ] Somewhere tell us about Outlines that we need reloading + limitations when working with them.
 [ ] GUI Design Documentation (Hard Error)
 [ ] Design of the dossier KERNEL (jozo) (severe error)
 [ ] Describe things in *. Qs files
 [ ] In scripting.xml tez further describe the scripting as such
 [ ] More examples in the scripting documentation
 [ ] User documentation (Hard Error)
 [x] Documentation dialog & utility framework (converted from. Leaf in QSA)
 [ ] Describe the meta-comment console script
 [ ] Somehow handbook "How to create scripts, where the CPAT", etc ...
 [ ] Document Keyboard Shortcuts (spec. type PgDn keystrokes, etc ...)
 [ ] Doxygen: set EXTRACT_ALL = YES (Warning lose the majority, but we are then guaranteed to complete documentation - just before handing in)
 [ ] Mention of bbox is in some weird units (pixels, see the documentation), the possible functions nas conversion


Configure
 [ ] To test the existence and versions of all libraries, especially QSA, where s 1.1.1 Although it goes to compile, but then it falls
 [ ] Document configure (in install.xml?)-MP
